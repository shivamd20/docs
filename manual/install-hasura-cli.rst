Installing the hasura CLI
=========================

Step 1: Install
---------------

   tabs:

         Open your linux shell and run the following command:

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -L https://hasura.io/install.sh | bash

         This will install the ``hasura`` CLI tool in ``/usr/local/bin``. You might have to provide
         your ``sudo`` password depending on the permissions of your ``/usr/local/bin`` location.

     - id: mac
       content: |
         In your terminal enter the following command:

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -L https://hasura.io/install.sh | bash

         This will install the ``hasura`` CLI in ``/usr/local/bin``. You might have to provide
         your ``sudo`` password depending on the permissions of your ``/usr/local/bin`` location.

     - id: windows

         **Note:** You should have ``git bash`` installed to use ``hasura`` CLI. Download git bash using the following `(link) <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`_

         Download the ``hasura`` installer:

         * `hasura (64-bit Windows installer) <https://hasura.io/install.msi>`_
         * `hasura (32-bit Windows installer) <https://storage.googleapis.com/hasuractl/stable/windows-386/hasura.msi>`_
         
         **Note:** Please run the installer as Administrator to avoid PATH updation errors. If you're still getting a `command not found` error after installing Hasura, please restart Gitbash.
