Email
=====

This section covers the documentation about configuring Notify to send emails. Notify currently supports sending emails via `SparkPost <https://www.sparkpost.com>`_ and `SMTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>`_.

Also, for testing out Notify, Hasura has its own test provider called ``Hasura`` which you can use to send 10 emails per day.
