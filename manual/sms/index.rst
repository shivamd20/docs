===

This section covers the documentation about configuring Notify to send SMS. Notify currently supports sending SMS via `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com>`_ and `MSG91 <https://msg91.com>`_.

Also, for testing out Notify, Hasura has its own test provider called ``Hasura`` which you can use to send 10 SMS per day.
