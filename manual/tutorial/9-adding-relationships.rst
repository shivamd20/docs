Part IX: Adding relationships to data models
===========================================

Exploiting relationships in your data
-------------------------------------

If our data API microservice could understand the different relationships in data, then
we would be able to make more complex and interesting queries to fetch data.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Current output of select query
   [{
      "id": 1,
      "title": "My first article",
      "content": "Lots of content...",
      "author_id": 3
   }]

   // Desired output of select query
   [{
      "id": 1,
      "title": "My first article",
      "content": "Lots of content...",
      "author_id": 3,
      "author": {
         "name": "Ramu"
         "id": 3
      }
   }]


Let's look at the different relationships we have in our data models:

* author:

  * has ``articles`` written by them
  * has ``comments`` posted by them
  * has ``liked_articles`` liked by them

* comment:

  * has an ``author`` who is the poster
  * has an ``article`` on which it was posted

* article:

  * has an ``author``
  * has ``comments``

* like:

  * has an ``author`` who has liked
  * has an ``article`` that has been liked

These relationships are captured by foreign key constraints where possible. If we were to represent rows of our table in JSON, as objects, then we can express these relationships as nested arrays or objects. Eg: Every ``author`` object can have a key called ``articles`` which is an array of article objects. Similarly, every ``article`` object can have a key called ``author`` which is an author object.

Let's see how these relationships are established.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Table
     - Relationship
     - Type
     - Established by
   * - author
     - articles
     - array
     - ``article(author_id) -> blog_user(hasura_id)``
   * - author
     - comments
     - array
     - ``comment(author_id) -> blog_user(hasura_id)``
   * - author
     - liked_articles
     - array
     - ``article_like(user_id) -> blog_user(hasura_id)``

   * - article
     - author
     - object
     - ``article(author_id) -> blog_user(hasura_id)``
   * - article
     - comments
     - array
     - ``comment(article_id) -> article(id)``
   * - article
     - categories
     - array
     - ``category(article_id) -> article(id)``

   * - article_like
     - liked_by
     - object
     - ``article_like(user_id) -> blog_user(hasura_id)``
   * - article_like
     - article
     - object
     - ``article_like(article_id) -> article(id)``

   * - comment
     - commented_by
     - object
     - ``comment(author_id) -> blog_user(hasura_id)``
   * - comment
     - article
     - object
     - ``comment(article_id) -> article(id)``

   * - category
     - articles
     - array
     - ``article_category(article_id) -> article(article_id)``

   * - article_category
     - article
     - object
     - ``article_category(article_id) -> article(id)``
   * - article_category
     - category
     - object
     - ``article_category(category_id) -> category(id)``

Creating relationships
----------------------

You can create relationship metadata for tables via the API console.

Let's say you wish to add an object relationsip for ``article(author_id) -> author(hasura_id)``. Navigate to the *Relationships* tab in the ``article`` table.

You'll see an entry in *suggested object relationships*:

.. figure:: ../../img/tutorial-10-new-rel-article.png

Click on *Add* to add a new object relationship and name the relationship:

.. figure:: ../../img/tutorial-10-add-new-rel-article.png

The relationship is created:

.. figure:: ../../img/tutorial-10-new-rel-added-article.png

You can create relationships for other constraints similarly.

If you have a lot of relationships that you'd like to add but not use the UI, you can send a bulk request to the ``data`` microservice:
	    
.. code-block:: http

  POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: <admin-token>

  {

		  },
		  "table": "comment",

	  },
	  {
	      "type": "create_array_relationship",
	      "args": {
		  "using": {
		      "foreign_key_constraint_on": {

	      }
	  },
	  {
	      "type": "create_object_relationship",
	      "args": {
		  "using": {
		      "foreign_key_constraint_on": "article_id"

		  "table": "article_category",

	  },
	  {
	      "type": "create_object_relationship",
	      "args": {

		      "foreign_key_constraint_on": "category_id"
		  },
		  "table": "article_category",
		  "name": "category"
	      }
	  }
      ]
  }



Queries using relationships
---------------------------

To obtain the **author**'s name from the article table, we issue,

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "columns": [
               "title",
               {
                   "name": "author",
                   "columns": ["name"]
               }
           ],
           "where" : {"is_published" : true}
       }
   }

The same syntax can be used to obtain the titles of all articles across all **authors**.

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "author",
           "columns": [
               "name",
               {
                   "name": "articles",
                   "columns": ["title"]
               }
           ]
       }
   }

You can use relationships inside ``where`` clause. For example, if we wish to only fetch all published articles by author with name ``Warren`` , we could :

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "columns": [ "id", "title"],
           "where" : {
               "is_published" : true,
               "author" : {
                   "name" : "Warren"
               }
           }
       }
   }

Let's fetch authors who have never published anything.

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "author",
           "columns": ["name"],
           "where" : {
               "$not" : {
                   "articles" : { "$any" : { "is_published" : true }}
               }
           }
       }
   }

As you probably guessed, relationships can be nested. Let's get all published articles with author information, comments and the author who posted the comment.

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "article",
           "columns": [
               "title",
               {
                   "name": "author",
                   "columns": ["name"]
               },
               {
                   "name" : "comments",
                   "columns" : [
                       "comment",
                       {
                           "name" : "commented_by",
                           "columns" : ["name"]
                       }
                   ]
               }
           ],
           "where" : {"is_published" : true}
       }
   }

We can also use ``where``, ``limit``, ``offset`` inside array relationships. Let's say we want to fetch all authors and only their published articles:

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   Authorization: <admin-token>

   {
       "type" : "select",
       "args" : {
           "table" : "author",
           "columns": [
               "name",
               {
                   "name": "articles",
                   "columns": ["title"],
                   "where" : { "is_published" : true }
               }
           ]
       }
   }
